Change file permissions

Symbolic method
The first and probably easiest way is the relative (or symbolic) method, which lets you specify permissions with single letter abbreviations. A chmod command using this method consists of at least three parts from the following lists:

Access class |	Operator	| Access Type
u (user)	| + (add access) 	| r (read)
g (group)	| - (remove access)	| w (write)
o (other)	| = (set exact access)	| x (execute)
a (all: u, g, and o)

~~~bash
chmod a+r myfile
