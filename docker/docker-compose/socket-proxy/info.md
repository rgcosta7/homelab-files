Giving access to your Docker socket could mean giving root access to your host, or even to your whole swarm, but some services require hooking into that socket to react to events, etc. Using this proxy lets you block anything you consider those services should not do.



This is a security-enhanced proxy for the Docker Socket.

Read the docs for the API version you are using, and know what you are doing.
